    # Introduction
    The Sinch APIs provide powerful business messaging capabilities across sending, receiving, and processing SMS, MMS, and rich messaging. 

    All requests to the Sinch REST API must be authenticated, this can either be done using Basic Authentication or by signing with a HMAC signature.

    # Features
    ###  De-Duplication 
    De-Duplication helps you avoid having to undertake data cleansing before commencing send outs.  
    It automatically detects and withholds messages deemed to be duplicates through the use of a 24-hour window – if a message is sent to the same number with the same content within a 24hr period, the subsequent message(s) will be withheld and rejected. To enable this, you don't need to make any changes to your application, just an account configuration change by Sinch's support team.

    ###  Social Sending 
    Social Sending permits messages to be sent only during sociable hours - i.e. 8am to 6pm (based on your accounts local time zone - not local time). 
    Messages sent outside of these hours are scheduled to be released during the next social time period. This feature helps businesses avoid send-outs during a time that would be deemed unsuitable by the customer. To enable this, you don't need to make any changes to your application, just an account configuration change by Sinch's support team.

    ###  Familiar Sender
    Familiar Sender ensures all communication sent to a customer are from the same phone number. 
    This allows businesses to build trust and familiarity with their customers and not confuse them by changing outgoing numbers. To enable this, you don't need to make any changes to your application, just an account configuration change by Sinch's support team.

    ### Character Converter
    Characters in a message may not always fall within the GSM-7 supported characterset, and when this occurs all 
    outbound messages will be encoded using UCS-2 leading to the customer being double-charged for the SMS. Character Converter 
    can help you avoid being double-charged for your SMS by converting all characters into the GSM-7 format ensuring you always 
    get the maximum characters into an SMS. Bear in my mind, this will downgrade all your unicode characters so for instance, 
    your emojis will be translated into a string of unknown characters (eg: �).  To enable this, you don't need to make any 
    changes to your application, just an account configuration change by Sinch's support team.

    description: >- 
    
      Every request requires an `Authorization` header in the following format:
      
      ```plain

      Authorization: Basic Base64(api_key:api_secret)

      ```
      
      Where the header consists of the Basic keyword followed by your Basic Authentication `api_key` and `api_secret` that you have been supplied by support, separated with a colon (:) which is then Base64 encoded.
      
      ### Example request with Basic Authentication
      
      ```plain

      POST /v1/messages HTTP/1.1

      Host: api.messagemedia.com

      Accept: application/json

      Content-Type: application/json

      Authorization: Basic dGhpc2lzYWtleTp0aGlzaXNhc2VjcmV0Zm9ybW1iYXNpY2F1dGhyZXN0YXBp

      {
        "messages": [
          {
            "content": "Hello World",
            "destination_number": "+61491570156",
            "format": "SMS"
          }
        ]
      } 
      
      ```
      
      _Note: spaces are used as indentation in the body of the above request._
  - name: HMAC Authentication
    description: >- 
      
      Every request requires an `Authorization` header in the following formats:
      
      For a request with a request body:
      
      ```plain

      Authorization: hmac username="<API KEY>", algorithm="hmac-sha256", headers  ="Date Content-MD5 request-line", signature="<SIGNATURE>"

      ```


      For a request _without_ a request body:


      ```plain

      Authorization: hmac username="<API KEY>", algorithm="hmac-sha256", headers="Date request-line", signature="<SIGNATURE>"

      ```
      
      ### To create this header

      #### Step 1

      Add a `Date` header to the request using the current date time in [RFC7231 Section 7.1.1.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.2) format

      #### Step 2

      If the request has a body, add a header called `Content-MD5` where the value of this header is an MD5 hash of the request body, otherwise this header is not required

      #### Step 3

      Create a signing string by concatenating the `Date` header, the

      `Content-MD5` header (if set) and the request line with line breaks:

      ```plain

      Date: Sat, 30 Jul 2016 05:13:23 GMT\nContent-MD5: 10fd4feab20d38432480c07301e49616\nPOST /v1/messages HTTP/1.1

      ```
      
      or

      ```plain

      Date: Sat, 30 Jul 2016 05:13:23 GMT\nGET /v1/messages/404b941b-2a29-469f-b114-9ea3e16bbe18 HTTP/1.1

      ```

      #### Step 4

      Create a SHA256 HMAC hash using the signing string and the secret key (both converted to bytes using UTF-8) ```HMAC-SHA256(signing string, secret)```

      #### Step 5

      Base64 encode the HMAC hash and include it as the signature in the ```Authorization``` header

      ### Example request with body

      ```plain

      POST /v1/messages HTTP/1.1

      Host: api.messagemedia.com

      Accept: application/json

      Content-Type: application/json

      Date: Sat, 30 Jul 2016 05:18:52 GMT

      Authorization: hmac username="uCXUdoogNfCsehEClbO2", algorithm="hmac-sha256", headers="Date Content-MD5 request-line", signature="Ia4G5lkhH/3NDYpix+8ZHUnp6bA="

      Content-MD5: 5407644fa83bec240dede971307e0cad

      Content-Length: 133

      {
        "messages": [
          {
            "content": "Hello World",
            "destination_number": "+61491570156",
          "format": "SMS"
          }
        ]
      }

      ```
      
      _Note: spaces are used as indentation in the body of the above request._

      ### Example request without body

      ```plain

      GET /v1/messages/404b941b-2a29-469f-b114-9ea3e16bbe18 HTTP/1.1

      Host: api.messagemedia.com

      Accept: application/json

      Date: Sat, 30 Jul 2016 05:18:52 GMT

      Authorization: hmac username="uCXUdoogNfCsehEClbO2", algorithm="hmac-sha256", headers="Date request-line", signature="NTUwMjUwNTVmZGYzZTIxODMyYjc1ZmM3M2EwZWQ1NzA3NzA4ZTZjNw=="

      ## SDKs
      Software Development Kits are available across six languages to assist with integration with the major endpoints. 

      In the event an SDK is not available or does not work with your environment, any standard HTTP client library can be used. These are some client libraries we recommend, 
      that include HMAC authentication capability: 

      ### C#
      [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/) with custom authenticator

      ### Java
      [Acquia HTTP Request Interceptor](https://github.com/acquia/http-hmac-java) for the Apache HTTP Client

      ### Javascript

      ## Performing actions on behalf of sub-accounts
      Using API keys at the parent account level, you can perform actions on behalf of a sub-account. 
      
      This feature is supported by the Messages, Replies, Delivery Reports and Webhooks APIs. 
      
      To do this
        include a header key ```Account``` with the sub-account ID as the value. For example:
        ```Account: mySubAccount```

        **Example request with Sending from sub-accounts**
      
        ```plain
        POST /v1/messages HTTP/1.1
        Host: api.messagemedia.com

        } 
        ```

  - name: Messages
    description: >-
      The Sinch Messages API provides a number of endpoints for building powerful two-way messaging applications. The Messages API provides access to three main resources:
      
      * Messages - Messages delivered from an application to a handset.
      
      * Delivery Reports - Real time reports on the delivery status of a message. As a message is processed, it's status may change several times before it is finally delivered to a handset.
      
      * Replies - Messages sent from a handset to an application. These messages are typically a reply to a previously sent message.

  - name: Source Address
    description: |
      The source address API provides several endpoints for you to request an SMS sender ID and track its approval status.
      
      **What is Trusted Sender ID?**

      Simply put, a sender ID is whatever you send a text message from. This is typically either a phone number, or a string of alphanumeric characters (commonly referred to as an “Alpha Tag”).

      With regulations surrounding SMS becoming much stricter all over the world in an effect to combat scam SMS messages, Sinch is working on “Trusted Sender ID” a concept that allows customers to request a Sender ID and have it verified.

      Currently, Trusted Sender ID supports two types of Sender ID: Alpha Tags and Personal (“Own”) Numbers. It will likely be extended to support additional number types, such as TFN and 10DLC where additional registration, (external) verification, and overall account whitelist of numbers will be required.

      ### Alpha Tag
        Sending messages from your brand name is particularly ideal for SMS marketing and two-factor authentication, as it increases recognition and trust. There are, however, a few considerations to be aware of. 
        
        Alpha tags are made up of 3-11 letters and/or numbers. Alpha tags must be registered and approved before sending and must have clear relevancy to your business and/or use case.
        
        Alpha Tags appear as the “From” number when you receive messages.
        
        A good alpha tag meets at least one of the following valid use cases: 
        * Business names
        * Trademark names    
        * Product or service name
        * an acronym, initialism, or contraction of your entity
        
        In addition to the requirements around clearly relating to the business, we typically advise the following for alpha tags to ensure maximum compatibility with the various carriers:
        * 6-11 characters long
        * Only contains characters from the following sets:
        * A-Z
        * a-z
        * 0-9
        * _ (underscore)
        * \- (hyphen)
        
        Alpha Tags can currently be registered through the Source Address API for the following countries: ```AD```, ```AI```, ```AL```, ```AS```, ```AT```, ```AU```, ```AW```, ```BA```, ```BB```, ```BH```, ```BW```, ```CD```, ```CH```, ```CK```, ```CY```, ```DE```, ```DJ```, ```DK```, ```DM```, ```EE```, ```ES```, ```FI```, ```FJ```, ```FM```, ```FO```, ```FR```, ```GB```, ```GD```, ```GG```, ```GI```, ```GL```, ```GM```, ```GQ```, ```GR```, ```GY```, ```IL```, ```IM```, ```IS```, ```JE```, ```JM```, ```JP```, ```KI```, ```KY```, ```LA```, ```LI```, ```LS```, ```LT```, ```LU```, ```LV```, ```MC```, ```ME```, ```MH```, ```MO```, ```MR```, ```MS```, ```MT```, ```MV```, ```NC```, ```NF```, ```NL```, ```NO```, ```NR```, ```NU```, ```PF```, ```PM```, ```PT```, ```SB```, ```SC```, ```SE```, ```SH```, ```SL```, ```SM```, ```ST```, ```TC```, ```TD```, ```TO```, ```VC```, ```VG``` and ```WS```
        
        To register an Alpha Tag as a sender ID you must:
        1. Make a request to the **Request a Sender Address** endpoint
        2. Wait for the alpha tag to be approved. The status of the alpha tag can be monitored using the **Get status of a sender address request** endpoint
        
        Once the alpha tag has been approved, you can begin using it as a Sender ID for SMS messages.

        ### Personal Number
        A personal number, or “My Own Number”, is a number that you own rather than one provided to you by Sinch. Typically, this is your personal mobile phone number. You may wish to register this number for use with our service so that you can easily send messages from a number already associated with your organisation.
        
        Before you can send messages using your own number, you need to verify that you have a right to use that number. Ensuring you have a right to use a phone number is an important regulatory requirement, aiming to prevent scam, spam, and misuse of messaging services.

        Personal numbers can currently be registered through the Source Address API for the following countries: ```AT```, ```AU```, ```CH```, ```CY```, ```DE```, ```DK```, ```EE```, ```ES```, ```FI```, ```GB```, ```HR```, ```IE```, ```IT```, ```LT```, ```LU```, ```LV```, ```MT```, ```NL```, ```NO```, ```PT```, ```SE```, and ```SI```

        To register a personal number as a Sender ID you must:
        1. Make a request to the **Request a Sender Address** endpoint
        2. A unique verification code will be sent to the requested number
        3. Make a request to the **Submitting a Verification Code** endpoint, using the verification code that was sent in the previous step. A 200 OK response will indicate the number has been verified and is ready for use.

        ⚠️ Own numbers need to be re-verified every 12 months. You will be notified by email that verification of your number is about to expire.

        ### Requesting a Source Address on behalf of a sub-account
        By default, all requests made through the API are made on behalf of the account that the API keys used to authorize the request were made on. API keys created on a parent account can request a source address on behalf of a sub-account. To do this, include a header key ```Account``` with the sub-account ID as the value. For example: 
        ```Account: mySubAccount```

        **Example request with Request a Sender Address from a sub-account**
        ```plain
        POST /v1/messaging/numbers/sender_address/requests HTTP/1.1
        Host: api.messagemedia.com
        Accept: application/json
        Content-Type: application/json
        Authorization: Basic dGhpc2lzYWtleTp0aGlzaXNhc2VjcmV0Zm9ybW1iYXNpY2F1dGhyZXN0YXBp
        Account: mySubAccount
        {
          "sender_address": "+61341234131",
          "sender_address_type": "INTERNATIONAL",
          "usage_type": "OWN_NUMBER",
          "destination_countries": [
              "AU"
          ],
          "reason": "I confirm that my business has a valid use case",
          "label": "my number sample"
        } 
        ```
        *Note: The use of the Account header key applies to all Source Address endpoints.*

  - name: Delivery Reports
    description: |
      If a callback URL is specified in the submit message request, then changes to the message status, 
      replies received in response to the message or delivery reports received for the message will be pushed via a HTTP POST request. An alternative to delivery reports via callbacks is custom webhooks using the webhooks management API. 
      
      All notifications are JSON encoded and the request expects to receive a response in the HTTP 200 range. If a valid response isn't received the request will be retried in an exponentially backing off fashion.

      Delivery Reports may carry an additional charge. For pricing, please contact your Account Manager or Support Team (support@app.sinch.com).

      For delivery reports or changes in the status of a message, the POST request to the specified URL will be as follows:
        
        _Note, multiple delivery report notifications will be recieved for a single message._
      
      ```json
      {
        "callback_url":"http://mockbin.org/bin/ac52ebd4-eca1-4c86-bf38-4dce79633906",
        "delivery_report_id":"693e87f2-a553-4281-9ffe-ddf04cbc4bf3",
        "source_number":"+61491570156",
        "date_received":"2016-11-03T11:49:02.807Z",
        "status":"delivered",
        "delay":0,
        "submitted_date":"2016-11-03T11:49:01.551Z",
        "original_text":"Hello world!",
        "message_id":"389dc1a8-62a4-4110-ba61-af94806c006f",
        "vendor_account_id":{
          "vendor_id":"MessageMedia",
          "account_id":"MyAccount"
        },
        "error_code":"220",
        "metadata":{
          "key":"value"
        }
      }
      ```


      The properties included in the notification are as follows:

      * **Callback URL**: The URL specified as the callback URL in the original submit message request.

      * **Delivery Report ID**: A unique ID for the delivery report that this notification represents.

      * **Source Number**: The destination address of the original message.

      * **Date Received**: The date and time at which this notification was generated in UTC.

      * **Status**: The status of the message as indicated by this delivery report. The status field can be one of the following values:

        * `enroute`: Message has been received by the gateway and is being processed (or waiting to be processed).

        * `submitted`: Message has been submitted to a provider/carrier for delivery.

        * `delivered`: Message delivery has been confirmed by the provider, including to the handset (where possible).

        * `expired`: The message has expired.

        * `rejected`: The message will not be delivered - permanent failure. Reasons may include usage limit exceeded, insufficient credit, number blocked, or content filtered

        * `failed`: The message has failed. Reasons may include no active routes to destination or undeliverable by downstream provider.

      * **Delay**: _Deprecated, no longer in use_

      * **Submitted Date**: Date time status of the message changed in UTC. For a delivered DR this may indicate the time at which the message was received on the handset.

      * **Original Text**: Text of the original message.

      * **Message ID**: ID of the original message.

      * **Vendor Account ID**: The account used to submit the original message. The vendor will always be `SinchEU`

      * **Error Code**: A status code which provides additional information about the message status:

        * `101`: Message being processed by the gateway.
        
        * `102`: Message is being rerouted to a different provider after failing via the first provider.
        
        * `151`: Message held for screening.
        
        * `200`: Message submitted to downstream provider for delivery.
        
        * `210`: Message accepted by downstream provider.
        
        * `211`: Message is enroute for delivery by provider.
        
        * `212`: Message submitted. Delivery pending.
        
        * `213`: Message scheduled for delivery by downstream provider.
        
        * `220`: Message delivered.
        
        * `221`: Message delivered to the handset.
        
        * `320`: Message validity period has expired (prior to submission).
        
        * `401`: Message validity period has expired (before delivery).
        
        * `301`: Usage threshold reached. Message discarded.
        
        * `302`: Destination address blocked. Message discarded.
        
        * `303`: Source address blocked. Message discarded.
        
        * `304`: Message dropped. Contact support.

      The number authorisation API allows you to manage your blacklists. Sinch automatically adds numbers to your blacklist if people send one of the opt-out keywords in response to one of your messages.
      
      This is a legal requirement. If you decide to handle the legal compliance yourself, calls to this endpoint will not affect your messages.

      The Numbers API allows your to purchase, provision and configure the dedicated numbers assigned to your Sinch account. 
      
      To learn more about the benefits of dedicated numbers, and their use cases, visit our [feature page](https://messagemedia.com/au/feature/dedicated-virtual-numbers/).
      
      This is a paid feature and must be enabled on your account. Please contact [support@app.sinch.com](support@app.sinch.com) or your account manager.
      
      ## Concepts

      This API allows you to purchase and assign to your account a number from a pool of dedicated numbers. Dedicated numbers are priced differently according to their classification.

      The following is the system by which we classify dedicated numbers. 

      | Pattern Type | Gold|  Silver |
      |---|---|---|
      | Same Number  |  Six of same (e.g. 999999) | Five of same (e.g. 999991 or 199999)  | 
      | Sequence  |  Six in sequence (e.g. 234567, or 765432) | Five in sequence (e.g. 245678, 456782, or 287654)  |
      |  Triplets |  Two identical (e.g. 123123) or two double (e.g. 444666) | Identical pairs within triplets (e.g. 004008, or 400800), one identical and one in sequence (e.g. 444789, or 345777), or mirror image (e.g. 468864)| 
      |Pair|Three identical (e.g. 454545)|Three non-identical (e.g. 447700) or three in sequence (e.g. 232425, or 090807)|

      Any numbers that do not meet the criteria for Gold or Silver are classified as Bronze.

      For pricing on dedicated numbers please refer to the Numbers page in our Hub web portal, or speak with your Sinch Account Manager.

      The Sinch Reports API provides a number of endpoints for running reports of messages sent and received through
      a Sinch Account. The API allows two kinds of reports, _Detailed Reports_ and _Summary Reports_.
      
      Detailed reports list all messages and the details of each message sent or received in a specified time period. Summary reports allow inbound and outbound message data to be aggregated on a number of dimensions.
  - name: Short Trackable Links Reports
    description: |
      Short Trackable Links is a feature available to [Messaging API](https://developers.messagemedia.com/code/messages-api-documentation/) users whereby it automatically and seamlessly shortens any URL to just 22 characters. Every shortened URL is unique to each recipient.

      The reporting API has endpoints specific to 
      this feature, allowing users to obtain details regarding 
      the number of click-throughs on each URL.

      To enable this feature on your account, contact your account manager or contact support on [support@app.sinch.com](support@app.sinch.com).

      To learn more about the benefits of the Short Trackable Links feature, [visit our feature page](https://messagemedia.com/au/feature/short-urls/).

      Webhooks Management API allows you to manage your webhooks configuration. You can subscribe to one or several events, retrieve the webhooks, update them or even delete them if needed.
  - name: Signature Key Management
    description: |
      As a Sinch customer, you want to be able to ensure that callbacks are coming from Sinch and not from a 3rd party. Since 
      these are calls to your own system, you should be provided with an extra level of security 
      when calling your resources.

      The Sinch Signature Key API provides a number of endpoints 
      for managing key used to sign each unique request to ensure security 
      and the requests can't (easily) be spoofed. This is similar to using 
      HMAC in your outbound messaging (rather than HTTP Basic).
      
      *Note: This API is only available in the APAC region.*

      The Signature Key API provides seven main endpoints:
      - ```Create signature key``` Create a new signature key for signature verification in callbacks.
      - ```Get signature key detail``` Retrieve the current detail of a signature key using the key_id returned in the ```create signature key``` endpoint.
      - ```Delete signature key``` Delete a signature key using the key_id returned in the ```create signature key``` endpoint.
      - ```Get signature key list``` Retrieve the paginated list of signature keys.
      - ```Enable signature key``` Enable a signature key using the key_id returned in the ```create signature key``` endpoint.
      - ```Get enabled signature key``` Retrieve the current enabled signature key.
      - ```Disable an enabled signature key``` Disable the current enabled signature key.
  - name: Mobile Landing Pages (beta)
    description: |
      The mobile landing pages (MLP) API provides the facilities to create mobile landing pages and sends them to recipients. This API is currently in beta. 
      
      *Note: This API is only available in the APAC region.*
        
      ## Concepts
      
      The approach to creating mobile landing pages involves creating a _Campaign_ and sending them to one or more _Recipients_.  A campaign consists of the baseline configuration of a mobile landing page and message that will be generated and sent to each recipient.

      ## Parameters
      
      Campaign and Recipients can contain parameters.  These parameters are used to customise the generated landing page and the message that is to be sent to each user.  Campaign and Recipient parameters are merged to form a complete set when processing a recipient.
      
      When resolving parameters sets, Recipient parameters override Campaign parameters with the same name.
      
      Parameter names used within the template have an associated type, which will be validated when creating the Campaign or sending it to Recipients.  You are free to define additional parameters for your own uses, such as when specifying the message.

      The SMS message that is to be sent to each user is defined at the Campaign level. 
      
      The message itself can consist of parameter references surrounded in `${...}`, for example:
      
      ```Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}, this is your message.```

      ## Sending Mobile Landing Pages 

      From end to end, sending a Mobile Landing Pages involves the following steps: 

      ### Step 1: Create a campaign

      Choose a template from the template catalogue, and work out what you are going to specify for the required parameters for that template. You will then use the `Create new campaign` endpoint to create the campaign. The following example 
      specifies the desired parameters for the template_id and sets up a message template:
      
      ```
      {
          "template_id": "ac895f01-3149-4bf8-a8fe-01d3b8a9ba97",
          "parameters": {
            "pageTitle": "The page title",
            "pageText": "The body text",
            "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
            "secondaryImageUrl": "https://www.example.com/optional_secondary_image.jpg",
            "buttonLink": "https://example.com/",
            "buttonText": "Call to Action Button Text",
            "secondaryButtonLink": "https://example.com/optional_secondary_button",
            "secondaryButtonText": "Secondary Call to Action Button"
          },
          "message": {
            "content": "Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}, this is the SMS message body",
            "metadata": {
              "key": "value"
            }
          }
      }
      ```
      
      Inside the message content the `{}` curly braces indicate template placeholders. These are the names of the parameters you will need to specify for the message when you send to your recipients.

      ### Step 2: Send to recipients

      Using the `Send campaign to recipients` endpoint, you can specify the id of your campaign in the path and a array of recipients as the payload. Each recipient will include an E.164 formatted 
      (international) phone number, an optional scheduled time, and values of any recipient scoped template parameters you may have created. In the following example the recipients have been scoped with the template parameters above: 

      ```
      {
        "recipients": [
          {
            "number": "+6140000000",
            "parameters": { "firstName":"Joe", "lastName","Bloe" }
          },
          {
            "number": "+6141111111",
            "parameters": { "firstName":"Jane", "lastName","Doe" }
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      ## Landing Page Store

      The Landing Page Store is used by the Hub portal to store landing page templates that have been configured using the visual interface. This means that you can 
      optionally use this data store to programatically send landing pages that have been designed and configured in the hub.
    
      If you have made a landing page in the hub, use the `Get landing pages` endpoint to find the landing pages you have made, along with the template and parameters that have been configured. 
      You will then need to copy those template and parameters into a campaign. 

      ## Template Parameters

      Each template will have different required parameters, shown in the Templates section. The following is a description of the requirements of each parameter when included in a template.

      summary: Cancel scheduled message
      description: |
        Cancel a scheduled message that has not yet been delivered.

        A scheduled message can be cancelled by updating the status of a message
        from ```scheduled``` to ```cancelled```. This is done by submitting a PUT request to the
        messages endpoint using the message ID as a parameter (the same endpoint used above to retrieve
        the status of a message). The expiry date for getting an entity is 45 days.

        The body of the request simply needs to contain a ```status``` property with the value set to ```cancelled```.

        ```json

        {
            "status": "cancelled"
        }

        ```

        *Note: Only messages with a status of scheduled can be cancelled. If an invalid or non existent message ID parameter is specified in the request, then a HTTP 404 Not Found response will be returned*

      summary: Send messages
      description: |
        Submit one or more (up to 100 per request) SMS, MMS or text to voice
        messages for delivery.

        The most basic message has the following structure:

        ```json

        {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "content": "My first message!",
                    "destination_number": "+61491570156"
                }
            ]
        }

        ```

        More advanced delivery features can be specified by setting the
        following properties in a message:

        - ```callback_url``` A URL can be included with each message to which
        Webhooks will be pushed to via a HTTP POST request. Webhooks will be sent if and when the status of the message changes as it is processed (if the delivery report property of the request is set to ```true```) and when replies are received. Specifying a callback URL is optional.

        - ```content``` The content of the message. This can be a Unicode string, up to 5,000 characters long.
          Message content is required.

        - ```delivery_report``` Delivery reports can be requested with each
        message. If delivery reports are requested, a webhook will be submitted to the ```callback_url``` property specified for the message (or to the webhooks)
          specified for the account every time the status of the message changes as it is processed. The
          current status of the message can also be retrieved via the Delivery Reports endpoint of the
          Messages API. Delivery reports are optional and by default will not be requested.

        - ```destination_number``` The destination number the message should be
        delivered to. This should be specified in E.164
          international format. For information on E.164, please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164.
          A destination number is required.

        - ```format``` The format specifies which format the message will be
        sent as, ```SMS``` (text message), ```MMS``` (multimedia message)
          or ```TTS``` (text to speech). With ```TTS``` format, we will call the destination number and read out the
          message using a computer generated voice. Specifying a format is optional, by default ```SMS``` will be used.

        - ```source_number_type``` If a source number is specified, the type of
        source number may also be
          specified. This is recommended when using a source address type that is not an internationally
          formatted number, available options are ```INTERNATIONAL```, ```ALPHANUMERIC``` or ```SHORTCODE```. Specifying a
          source number type is only valid when the ```source_number``` parameter is specified and is optional.
          If a source number is specified and no source number type is specified, the source number type will be
          inferred from the source number, however this may be inaccurate.
        
        - ```source_number```[optional]  Specify a source number to be used.  Refer to the section below for more information on source numbers.  
        ⚠️ The number or sender ID must be registered to your account (from 1-Mar-2024).
        
          #### Source number (sender ID)
          
          There are several options for the number or sender ID that will show as the source of an outbound message. Some things to note:
            - If you do not specify a source number, the message will be sent with the default number for your account.
              - The default may be a number you have purchased from us - such as a dedicated number, a 10-digit longcode or toll-free number (US/CA), or a shortcode. Log into the web portal to manage your numbers.
              - If your account has multiple numbers, you can specify which source number to use in the request.
              - If your account does not have a number, your message may be sent using our shared number pool (in certain countries only)
            - `Alpha tag:` In some countries (AU, GB, some others), you may be able to send using an alpha tag - text that represents your brand of business.  Before using an alpha tag, you must register it in the Numbers section of the web portal.
            - `Other numbers:` You may use numbers that you own as the source number, but you must register them in the Numbers section of the web portal to confirm  you have a right to use the number.
          If you need to register a large number of source numbers/sender IDs, consider using our [Source Address API](https://messagemedia.github.io/documentation/#tag/Source-Address)
          
          ⚠️ If you specify a source_number that is not registered to your account, the message may fail to send, or may be sent with an alternative number.

        - ```media``` The media is used to specify a list of URLs of the media file(s) that you are trying to send. 
        Supported file formats include png, jpeg and gif. ```format``` parameter must be set to ```MMS``` for this to
        work.

        - ```subject``` The subject field is used to denote subject of the MMS
        message and has a maximum size of 64 characters long. Specifying a
        subject is optional.

        - ```scheduled``` A message can be scheduled for delivery in the future
        by setting the scheduled property.
          The scheduled property expects a date time specified in ISO 8601 format. The scheduled time must be
          provided in UTC and is optional. If no scheduled property is set, the message will be delivered immediately.

        - ```message_expiry_timestamp``` A message expiry timestamp can be
        provided to specify the latest time
          at which the message should be delivered. If the message cannot be delivered before the specified
          message expiry timestamp elapses, the message will be discarded. Specifying a message expiry 
          timestamp is optional.

        - ```metadata``` Metadata can be included with the message which will
        then be included with any delivery
          reports or replies matched to the message. This can be used to create powerful two-way messaging
          applications without having to store persistent data in the application. Up to 10 key / value metadata data
          pairs can be specified in a message. Each key can be up to 100 characters long, and each value up to 
          256 characters long. Specifying metadata for a message is optional.
        
        The response body of a successful POST request to the messages endpoint
        will include a ```messages``` property which contains a list of all messages submitted. The list of
        messages submitted will reflect the list of messages included in the request, but each message
        will also contain two new properties, ```message_id``` and ```status```. The returned message ID
        will be a 36 character UUID which can be used to check the status of the message via the Get Message
        Status endpoint. The status of the message which reflect the status of the message at submission
        time which will always be ```queued```. See the Delivery Reports section of this documentation for
        more information on message statuses.
        
        *Note: when sending multiple messages in a request, all messages must be valid for the request 
        to be successful. If any messages in the request are invalid, no messages will be sent.*

        OWN_NUMBER Sender Addresses require reverification every 12 months to allow continued use.
        The reverification process is quite similar to the original verification process for the Sender Address, and requires a fresh 2FA check.
        
        To reverify an OWN_NUMBER Sender Address:
          1. Retrieve the UUID for the OWN_NUMBER using the **Get all approved sender addresses** endpoint
          2. Make a request to this endpoint to trigger the 2FA check
          3. Make a PATCH request to the **Submit verification code endpoint**, providing the new 2FA code in the body of the request

      description: >-
        Check for any delivery reports that have been received.

        Delivery reports are a notification of the change in status of a message
        as it is being processed.

        Each request to the check delivery reports endpoint will return any
        delivery reports received that

        have not yet been confirmed using the confirm delivery reports endpoint.
        A response from the check

        delivery reports endpoint will have the following structure:

        ```json

        {
            "delivery_reports": [

                    },
                    "metadata": {
                        "key1": "value1",
                        "key2": "value2"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "callback_url": "https://my.callback.url.com",
                    "delivery_report_id": "0edf9022-7ccc-43e6-acab-480e93e98c1b",

                        "vendor_id": "SinchEU",
                        "account_id": "MyAccount"
                    },
                    "metadata": {
                        "key1": "value1",
                        "key2": "value2"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }

        ```

        Each delivery report will contain details about the message, including
        any metadata specified

        and the new status of the message (as each delivery report indicates a
        change in status of a

        message) and the timestamp at which the status changed. Every delivery
        report will have a 

        unique delivery report ID for use with the confirm delivery reports
        endpoint.

        *Note: The source number and destination number properties in a delivery
        report are the inverse of

        those specified in the message that the delivery report relates to. The
        source number of the

        delivery report is the destination number of the original message.*

        Subsequent requests to the check delivery reports endpoint will return
        the same delivery reports

        and a maximum of 100 delivery reports will be returned in each request.
        Applications should use the

        confirm delivery reports endpoint in the following pattern so that
        delivery reports that have been

        processed are no longer returned in subsequent check delivery reports
        requests. The expiry date for getting an entity is 45 days.

        1. Call check delivery reports endpoint

        2. Process each delivery report

        3. Confirm all processed delivery reports using the confirm delivery
        reports endpoint

        *Note: It is recommended to use the Webhooks feature to receive reply
        messages rather than

        polling the check delivery reports endpoint.*

      summary: Confirm delivery reports as received
      description: >-
        Mark a delivery report as confirmed so it is no longer return in check
        delivery reports requests.

        The confirm delivery reports endpoint is intended to be used in
        conjunction with the check delivery

        reports endpoint to allow for robust processing of delivery reports.
        Once one or more delivery

        reports have been processed, they can then be confirmed using the
        confirm delivery reports endpoint so they

        are no longer returned in subsequent check delivery reports requests.

        The confirm delivery reports endpoint takes a list of delivery report
        IDs as follows:

        ```json

        {
            "delivery_report_ids": [
                "011dcead-6988-4ad6-a1c7-6b6c68ea628d",
                "3487b3fa-6586-4979-a233-2d1b095c7718",
                "ba28e94b-c83d-4759-98e7-ff9c7edb87a1"
            ]
        }

        ```

        The expiry date for getting an entity is 45 days. Up to 100 delivery reports can be confirmed in a single confirm delivery
        reports request.

      description: >-
        Check for any replies that have been received.

        Replies are messages that have been sent from a handset in response to a
        message sent by an

        application or messages that have been sent from a handset to a inbound
        number associated with

        an account, known as a dedicated inbound number (contact
        <support@app.sinch.com> for more

        information on dedicated inbound numbers).

        Each request to the check replies endpoint will return any replies
        received that have not yet

        been confirmed using the confirm replies endpoint. A response from the
        check replies endpoint

        will have the following structure:

                    "vendor_account_id": {
                        "vendor_id": "SinchEU",
                        "account_id": "MyAccount"
                    },
                    "content": "My first reply!"
                },
                {
                    "metadata": {

                    "date_received": "2016-12-07T08:43:00.850Z",
                    "callback_url": "https://my.callback.url.com",

                    "source_number": "+61491570158",
                    "vendor_account_id": {
                        "vendor_id": "SinchEU",
                        "account_id": "MyAccount"
                    },
                    "content": "My second reply!"
                }
            ]
        }

        ```

        Each reply will contain details about the reply message, as well as
        details of the message the reply was sent

        in response to, including any metadata specified. Every reply will have
        a reply ID to be used with the

        confirm replies endpoint.

        *Note: The source number and destination number properties in a reply
        are the inverse of those

        specified in the message the reply is in response to. The source number
        of the reply message is the

        same as the destination number of the original message, and the
        destination number of the reply

        message is the same as the source number of the original message. If a
        source number

        wasn't specified in the original message, then the destination number
        property will not be present

        in the reply message.*

        Subsequent requests to the check replies endpoint will return the same
        reply messages and a maximum

        of 100 replies will be returned in each request. Applications should use
        the confirm replies endpoint

        in the following pattern so that replies that have been processed are no
        longer returned in

        subsequent check replies requests. The expiry date for getting an entity is 45 days.

        1. Call check replies endpoint

        2. Process each reply message

        3. Confirm all processed reply messages using the confirm replies
        endpoint

        *Note: It is recommended to use the Webhooks feature to receive reply
        messages rather than polling

        the check replies endpoint.*

      summary: Create webhook
      description: |
        Create a webhook for one or more of the specified events.
        
        A webhook would typically have the following structure:
        
        ```
        { 
          "url": "http://webhook.com",
          "method": "POST",
          "encoding": "JSON",  
          "headers": {"Account": "DeveloperPortal7000"  },  
          "events": ["RECEIVED_SMS"  ],
          "template": {
            "id":"$mtId",
            "status":"$statusCode"}
          "read_timeout": 5000,
          "retries": 3,
          "retry_delay": 30
          }

        ```
        
        A valid webhook must consist of the following properties:
        
        - ```url``` The configured URL which will trigger the webhook when a selected event occurs.
        
        - ```method``` The methods to map CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations to HTTP requests.
        
        - ```encoding``` Webhooks can be delivered using different content types. You can choose from ```JSON```, ```FORM_ENCODED``` or ```XML```. This will automatically add the Content-Type header for you so you don't have to add it again in the `headers` property.
        
        - ```headers``` HTTP header fields which provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. This should NOT include the `Content-Type` header.
        
        - ```events``` Event or events that will trigger the webhook. Atleast one event should be present.
        
        - ```template``` The structure of the payload that will be returned. You can format this in JSON or XML.
        
        - ```read_timeout``` (Optional) The read timeout for the call to the Webhook in milliseconds. Set to 20000 by default, max 60000.
        
        - ```retries``` (Optional) The read timeout for the call to the Webhook in milliseconds. Set to 20000 by default, max 60000.
        
        - ```retry_delay``` (Optional) The delay period between retries in seconds. Minimum of 5, max 60.



        
        #### Types of Events
        
        You can select all of the events (listed below) or combine them in whatever way you like but atleast one event must be used. Otherwise, the webhook won't be created.
        
        A webhook will be triggered when any one or more of the events occur:
        
        + **SMS** 
          + `RECEIVED_SMS` Receive an SMS
          + `OPT_OUT_SMS` Opt-out occured
        + **MMS**
          + `RECEIVED_MMS` Receive an MMS
        + **DR (Delivery Reports)**
          + `ENROUTE_DR` Message is enroute
          + `EXPIRED_DR` Message has expired
          + `REJECTED_DR` Message is rejected
          + `FAILED_DR` Message has failed
          + `DELIVERED_DR` Message is delivered
          + `SUBMITTED_DR` Message is submitted

        #### Template Parameters
        
        You can choose what to include in the data that will be sent as the payload via the Webhook. It's upto you to choose what format you would like the payload to be returned. You can choose between JSON or XML.
        
        Keep in my mind, if you've chosen JSON as the format, you must escape the JSON in the template value (see example above).
        
        The table illustrates a list of all the parameters that can be included in the template and which event types it can be applied to.

         #### Message Statuses
        
        Delivery Reports indicate message status. A message can have one of the following statuses:
        * `enroute`: Message has been received by the gateway and is being processed (or waiting to be processed).
        * `submitted`: Message has been submitted to a provider/carrier for delivery.
        * `delivered`: Message delivery has been confirmed by the provider, including to the handset (where possible).
        * `expired`: The message has expired.
        * `rejected`: The message will not be delivered - permanent failure. Reasons may include usage limit exceeded, insufficient credit, number blocked, or content filtered
        * `failed`: The message has failed. Reasons may include no active routes to destination or undeliverable by downstream provider.
        
        #### Message Status Codes
        Status codes provide more granular insight into a message's status. A message can have one of the following status codes:
        * `101`: Message being processed by the gateway.
        * `102`: Message is being rerouted to a different provider after failing via the first provider.
        * `151`: Message held for screening.
        * `200`: Message submitted to downstream provider for  delivery.
        * `210`: Message accepted by downstream provider.
        * `211`: Message is enroute for delivery by provider.
        * `212`: Message submitted. Delivery pending.
        * `213`: Message scheduled for delivery by downstream  provider.
        * `220`: Message delivered.
        * `221`: Message delivered to the handset.
        * `320`: Message validity period has expired (prior to  submission).
        * `401`: Message validity period has expired (before delivery ).
        * `301`: Usage threshold reached. Message discarded.
        * `302`: Destination address blocked. Message discarded.
        * `303`: Source address blocked. Message discarded.
        * `304`: Message dropped. Contact support.
        * `305`: Message discarded due to duplicate detection.
        * `402`: Message rejected by downstream provider.
        * `403`: Message skipped by downstream provider.
        * `410`: Invalid source address.
        * `411`: Invalid destination address.
        * `412`: Destination address blocked.
        * `413`: SMS service unavailable on destination.
        * `414`: Destination unreachable.
        * `330`: Gateway failure.
        * `331`: Message discarded.
        * `332`: No available route to destination.
        * `333`: Source address unsupported for this destination.
        * `400`: Message failed; undeliverable.
        * `405`: Message cancelled or deleted by provider.
        
        *Note: A 400 response will be returned if the `url` is invalid, the `events`, `encoding` or `method` is null or the `headers` has a Content-Type  attribute.*

      description: >-
        This will create a key pair:


        - The ```private key``` stored in Sinch is used to create the signature.


        - The ```public key``` is returned and stored at your side to verify the signature in callbacks.


        You need to enable your signature key after creating.


        The most basic body has the following structure:


        ```json

        {
            "digest": "SHA224",
            "cipher": "RSA"
        }

        ```


        - ```digest``` is used to hash the message. The valid values for digest type are: SHA224, SHA256, SHA512


        - ```cipher``` is used to encrypt the hashed message. The valid value for cipher type is: RSA


        A successful request for the ```create signature key``` endpoint will return a response body as follows:


        ```json

        {
            "key_id": "7ca628a8-08b0-4e42-aeb8-960b37049c31",
            "public_key": "MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCTIxtRyT5CuOD74r7UCT+AKzWNxvaAP9myjAqR7+vBnJKEvoPnmbKTnm6uLlxutnMbjKrnCCWnQ9vtBVnnd+ElhwLDPADfMcJoOqwi7mTcxucckeEbBsfsgYRfdacxgSZL8hVD1hLViQr3xwjEIkJcx1w3x8npvwMuTY0uW8+PjwIDAQAB",

            "enabled": false
        }

        ```


        The response body of a successful POST request to the ```create signature key``` endpoint will contain six properties:


        - ```key_id``` will be a 36 character UUID which can be used to enable, delete or get the details.


        - ```public_key``` is used to decrypt the signature.


        - ```cipher``` same as cipher in request body.


        - ```digest``` same as digest in request body.


        - ```created``` is the created date.


        - ```enabled``` is false for the new signature key. You can use the ```enable signature key``` endpoint to set this field to true.

        Enable a signature key using the key_id returned in the ```create signature key``` endpoint.

        There is only one signature key is enabled at the one moment in time. So if you enable the new signature key, the old one will be disabled.


        The most basic body has the following structure:


        ```json

        {
            "key_id": "7ca628a8-08b0-4e42-aeb8-960b37049c31"
        }

        ```


        The response body of a successful PATCH request to ```enable signature key``` endpoint will contain the ```enabled``` properties with the value is true as follows:


        ```json

        {
            "key_id": "7ca628a8-08b0-4e42-aeb8-960b37049c31",

        ### Events Types


        The campaign report consists of a series of events, that were generated by recipients when

        interacting with the generated mobile landing page.  The set of events that are currently supported

        are as follows:


        | Event Type        | Event Source | Description                                    |

        |:------------------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------|

        | `PAGE_OPEN`       | n/a          | The page was opened in a browser.              |

        | `BUTTON_CLICKED`  | Button label | One of the Call to Action buttons was clicked. |

        | `FORM_SUBMITTED`  | n/a          | A form has been submitted with the captured data stored in the 'data' field. |Returns the breakdown of events and recipients of a particular campaign.


        This will contain the following bits of information:


        - The total number of events recorded for the particular campaign.


        - The number of unique engagements.  This is the number of recipients for which there exists at least one recorded event.


        - A breakdown of the number of the total number of events grouped by the event type and event source


        The event breakdown will return the following information for each event and source type:


        - The total number of recorded events of that type and source


        - The number of unique recipients for which that event and source was recorded for at least once


        For example, if a recipient opened the landing page three times, the number of recorded events will be 3 but the number of unique recipients will be 1.
