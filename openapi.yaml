    # Introduction
    The MessageMedia APIs provide powerful business messaging capabilities across sending, receiving, and processing SMS, MMS, and rich messaging. 

    All requests to the MessageMedia REST API must be authenticated, this can either be done using Basic Authentication or by signing with a HMAC signature.
      
    # Credentials
      
    To access the API, an API key and secret are required.

    # Features
    ###  De-Duplication 
    De-Duplication helps you avoid having to undertake data cleansing before commencing send outs.  
    It automatically detects and withholds messages deemed to be duplicates through the use of a 24-hour window – if a message is sent to the same number with the same content within a 24hr period, the subsequent message(s) will be withheld and rejected. To enable this, you don't need to make any changes to your application, just an account configuration change by MessageMedia's support team.

    ###  Social Sending 
    Social Sending permits messages to be sent only during sociable hours - i.e. 8am to 6pm (based on your accounts local time zone - not local time). 
    Messages sent outside of these hours are scheduled to be released during the next social time period. This feature helps businesses avoid send-outs during a time that would be deemed unsuitable by the customer. To enable this, you don't need to make any changes to your application, just an account configuration change by MessageMedia's support team.

    ###  Familiar Sender
    Familiar Sender ensures all communication sent to a customer are from the same phone number. 
    This allows businesses to build trust and familiarity with their customers and not confuse them by changing outgoing numbers. To enable this, you don't need to make any changes to your application, just an account configuration change by MessageMedia's support team.

    ### Character Converter
    Characters in a message may not always fall within the GSM-7 supported characterset, and when this occurs all 
    outbound messages will be encoded using UCS-2 leading to the customer being double-charged for the SMS. Character Converter 
    can help you avoid being double-charged for your SMS by converting all characters into the GSM-7 format ensuring you always 
    get the maximum characters into an SMS. Bear in my mind, this will downgrade all your unicode characters so for instance, 
    your emojis will be translated into a string of unknown characters (eg: �).  To enable this, you don't need to make any 
    changes to your application, just an account configuration change by MessageMedia's support team.
tags:
  - name: Basic Authentication
    description: |-

      Every request requires an `Authorization` header in the following format:
      ```plain
      Authorization: Basic Base64(api_key:api_secret)
      ```
      Where the header consists of the Basic keyword followed by your Basic Authentication `api_key` and `api_secret` that you have been supplied by support, separated with a colon (:) which is then Base64 encoded.
      ### Example request with Basic Authentication
      ```plain
      POST /v1/messages HTTP/1.1
      Host: api.messagemedia.com
      Accept: application/json
      Content-Type: application/json
      Authorization: Basic dGhpc2lzYWtleTp0aGlzaXNhc2VjcmV0Zm9ybW1iYXNpY2F1dGhyZXN0YXBp
      {
        "messages": [
          {
            "content": "Hello World",
            "destination_number": "+61491570156",
            "format": "SMS"
          }
        ]
      } 
      ```
      _Note: spaces are used as indentation in the body of the above request._
  - name: HMAC Authentication
    description: |-

      Every request requires an `Authorization` header in the following formats:
      For a request with a request body:
      ```plain
      Authorization: hmac username="<API KEY>", algorithm="hmac-sha1", headers  ="Date Content-MD5 request-line", signature="<SIGNATURE>"
      ```

      For a request _without_ a request body:

      ```plain
      Authorization: hmac username="<API KEY>", algorithm="hmac-sha1", headers="Date request-line", signature="<SIGNATURE>"
      ```
      ### To create this header
      #### Step 1
      Add a `Date` header to the request using the current date time in [RFC7231 Section 7.1.1.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.2) format
      #### Step 2
      If the request has a body, add a header called `Content-MD5` where the value of this header is an MD5 hash of the request body, otherwise this header is not required
      #### Step 3
      Create a signing string by concatenating the `Date` header, the
      `Content-MD5` header (if set) and the request line with line breaks:
      ```plain
      Date: Sat, 30 Jul 2016 05:13:23 GMT\nContent-MD5: 10fd4feab20d38432480c07301e49616\nPOST /v1/messages HTTP/1.1
      ```
      or
      ```plain
      Date: Sat, 30 Jul 2016 05:13:23 GMT\nGET /v1/messages/404b941b-2a29-469f-b114-9ea3e16bbe18 HTTP/1.1
      ```
      #### Step 4
      Create a SHA1 HMAC hash using the signing string and the secret key (both converted to bytes using UTF-8) ```HMAC-SHA1(signing string, secret)```
      #### Step 5
      Base64 encode the HMAC hash and include it as the signature in the ```Authorization``` header
      ### Example request with body
      ```plain
      POST /v1/messages HTTP/1.1
      Host: api.messagemedia.com
      Accept: application/json
      Content-Type: application/json
      Date: Sat, 30 Jul 2016 05:18:52 GMT
      Authorization: hmac username="uCXUdoogNfCsehEClbO2", algorithm="hmac-sha1", headers="Date Content-MD5 request-line", signature="Ia4G5lkhH/3NDYpix+8ZHUnp6bA="
      Content-MD5: 5407644fa83bec240dede971307e0cad
      Content-Length: 133
      {
        "messages": [
          {
            "content": "Hello World",
            "destination_number": "+61491570156",
          "format": "SMS"
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
      _Note: spaces are used as indentation in the body of the above request._
      ### Example request without body
      ```plain
      GET /v1/messages/404b941b-2a29-469f-b114-9ea3e16bbe18 HTTP/1.1
      Host: api.messagemedia.com
      Accept: application/json
      Date: Sat, 30 Jul 2016 05:18:52 GMT
      Authorization: hmac username="uCXUdoogNfCsehEClbO2", algorithm="hmac-sha1", headers="Date request-line", signature="NTUwMjUwNTVmZGYzZTIxODMyYjc1ZmM3M2EwZWQ1NzA3NzA4ZTZjNw==" ```

      ## SDKs
      Software Development Kits are available across six languages to assist with integration with the major endpoints. 

      In the event an SDK is not available or does not work with your environment, any standard HTTP client library can be used. These are some client libraries we recommend, 
      that include HMAC authentication capability: 

      ### C#
      [RestSharp](http://restsharp.org/) with custom authenticator

      ### Java
      [Acquia HTTP Request Interceptor](https://github.com/acquia/http-hmac-java) for the Apache HTTP Client

      ### Javascript
      [Acquia HTTP HMAC Signer for JavaScript](https://github.com/acquia/http-hmac-javascript)

      ### PHP
      [HTTP HMAC Signer for PHP](https://github.com/acquia/http-hmac-php) Which can be used with [Guzzle](http://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/).

      ### Python
      [HMAC](https://github.com/guardian/httpie-hmac-auth) auth plugin for [HTTPie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie).

      ### Ruby
      [APIAuth](https://github.com/mgomes/api_auth) Ruby Gem 

      ## Postman Collections

    description: |-
      The MessageMedia Messages API provides a number of endpoints for building powerful two-way messaging applications. The Messages API provides access to three main resources:
      * Messages - Messages delivered from an application to a handset.
      * Delivery Reports - Real time reports on the delivery status of a message. As a message is processed, it's status may change several times before it is finally delivered to a handset.
      * Replies - Messages sent from a handset to an application. These messages are typically a reply to a previously sent message.
      ![Message Flow](https://i.imgur.com/jJeHwf5.png)
  - name: Delivery Reports
    description: |
      If a callback URL is specified in the submit message request, then changes to the message status, 
      replies received in response to the message or delivery reports received for the message will be pushed via a HTTP POST request. An alternative to delivery reports via callbacks is custom webhooks using the webhooks management API. 

      All notifications are JSON encoded and the request expects to receive a response in the HTTP 200 range. If a valid response isn't received the request will be retried in an exponentially backing off fashion.

      Delivery Reports may carry an additional charge. For pricing, please contact your Account Manager or Support Team (support@messagemedia.com).

      For delivery reports or changes in the status of a message, the POST request to the specified URL will be as follows:
        
        _Note, multiple delivery report notifications will be recieved for a single message._

      ```json
      {
        "callback_url":"http://mockbin.org/bin/ac52ebd4-eca1-4c86-bf38-4dce79633906",
        "delivery_report_id":"693e87f2-a553-4281-9ffe-ddf04cbc4bf3",
        "source_number":"+61491570156",
        "date_received":"2016-11-03T11:49:02.807Z",
        "status":"delivered",
        "delay":0,
        "submitted_date":"2016-11-03T11:49:01.551Z",
        "original_text":"Hello world!",
        "message_id":"389dc1a8-62a4-4110-ba61-af94806c006f",
        "vendor_account_id":{
          "vendor_id":"MessageMedia",
          "account_id":"MyAccount"
        },
        "error_code":"220",
        "metadata":{
          "key":"value"
        }
      }
      ```


      The properties included in the notification are as follows:

      * **Callback URL**: The URL specified as the callback URL in the original submit message request.

      * **Delivery Report ID**: A unique ID for the delivery report that this notification represents.

      * **Source Number**: The destination address of the original message.

      * **Date Received**: The date and time at which this notification was generated in UTC.

      * **Status**: The status of the message as indicated by this delivery report. The status field can be one of the following values:

        * `enroute`: Message has been received by the gateway and is being processed (or waiting to be processed).

        * `submitted`: Message has been submitted to a provider/carrier for delivery.

        * `delivered`: Message delivery has been confirmed by the provider, including to the handset (where possible).

        * `expired`: The message has expired.

        * `rejected`: The message will not be delivered - permanent failure. Reasons may include usage limit exceeded, insufficient credit, number blocked, or content filtered

        * `failed`: The message has failed. Reasons may include no active routes to destination or undeliverable by downstream provider.

      * **Delay**: _Deprecated, no longer in use_

      * **Submitted Date**: Date time status of the message changed in UTC. For a delivered DR this may indicate the time at which the message was received on the handset.

      * **Original Text**: Text of the original message.

      * **Message ID**: ID of the original message.

      * **Vendor Account ID**: The account used to submit the original message. The vendor will always be `MessageMedia`

      * **Error Code**: A status code which provides additional information about the message status:

        * `101`: Message being processed by the gateway.
        
        * `102`: Message is being rerouted to a different provider after failing via the first provider.
        
        * `151`: Message held for screening.
        
        * `200`: Message submitted to downstream provider for delivery.

        * `220`: Message delivered.
        
        * `221`: Message delivered to the handset.
        
        * `320`: Message validity period has expired (prior to submission).
        
        * `401`: Message validity period has expired (before delivery).
        
        * `301`: Usage threshold reached. Message discarded.
        
        * `302`: Destination address blocked. Message discarded.
        
        * `303`: Source address blocked. Message discarded.

      How confident are you in the accuracy of your database? Sending text messages to inactive, invalid or unrecognisable numbers wastes resources on messages that will never be read.

      Our Lookups API provides a simple way to keep your database clean. It accesses mobile carrier information about any mobile number, in real-time, anywhere in the world.
      * Identify invalid numbers and reduce the number of failed or undeliverable messages  
      * Separate mobiles and landlines, so you don’t pay for messages that will never be delivered 
      * Identify carriers to determine which are low cost

      To learn more about the benefits of the Lookups API, [visit our product page](https://www.messagemedia.com/au/feature/lookups/).

      ![Lookups](https://developers.messagemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lookups-api.png)

      Required Parameters

      `{phone_number} `
      This should be set to the phone number to be looked up. 

      By default, a request will only return the country_code and phone_number properties in the response.
      ```json
      {
        "country_code": "AU",
        "phone_number": "+61491570156",
      }
      ```

      Options for Parameters

      The options query parameter can also be used to request additional information about the phone number. 

      * `carrier` Request details about the carrier.
      * `type` Use as a value of the options parameter

      _Note: The `carrier` and the `type` values can be used together using a comma separated list, i.e. carrier,type._ 

      * `hlr` Request details about the location by including as a value of the options parameter.

      _NOTE: The `hlr` value CANNOT be used in conjunction with the other values.
  - name: Number Authorisation
    description: |-
      The number authorisation API allows you to manage your blacklists. MessageMedia automatically adds numbers to your blacklist if people send one of the opt-out keywords in response to one of your messages.
      This is a legal requirement. If you decide to handle the legal compliance yourself, calls to this endpoint will not affect your messages.

    description: |
      This documentation assumes that you have already created a key pair using the [Signature Key Management API](https://developers.messagemedia.com/code/signature-key-managment-api-documentation/).

      Once you have enabled this feature, all webhooks sent will be signed using the private key created via the Signature Key Management API.

      ## Headers

      Every signed webhook will have the following additional headers:
        * `X-MESSAGEMEDIA-KEY-ID`: The uuid of the key used eg: `628fdf4e-bddc-4029-ae59-f9a84a22165c`
        * `X-MESSAGEMEDIA-CIPHER-TYPE`: Encryption algorithm used for digest encryption eg: `RSA`
        * `X-MESSAGEMEDIA-DIGEST-TYPE`: The algorithm used for digest eg: `SHA256`
        * `X-MESSAGEMEDIA-SIGNATURE`: The encrypted digest value which is base64 encoded. This is the signature you will verify against eg: `YdhajTA1p68BrxtWq0hvupEQxA4eliL2rA0tyN5YyuCsJwdYc0tZ8439nQ3KrQCmnsDCoB024lKv3FKhWrWAQldl6tEqpiaabXqJMRAHTAtSph+4R1O3C0tT8WNVNP6wEYOKoPyg1tI43uXOQ8iC4Xr4pIeXaYNkEosPG5I8ZyoiNjy/FW7rdO/QuxtfYcpBqLOE+MG0lHwNTiXkc+JlG0VHQbRg8TmjtmsJEsvB4KGPLqpPBij9v/1fzEagkyLECN+tAHgZY/xjQbhm3xL0cEbMNouYKpK7lg8vyechlkPX5j4hEJMo4u/+5iOw3EFYGPjA9RnneINB6DhbzGM99A==`
        * `DATE`: Date-Time at which the webhook was sent eg: `Tue, 17 Jul 2018 04:52:31 GMT`


      ## Create the comparison string

      To be able to verify the signature, you need to build a comparison string by combining the following:
      * `Request-Line`: The Request-Line begins with a method token, followed by the Request-URI and the protocol version. This can be found in the first line of the request message. eg: `POST /data HTTP/1.1`
      * `Date`: This Date is the one sent in the header eg: `Tue, 17 Jul 2018 04:52:31 GMT`
      * `Body`: This is the the body of the request that is sent back when the webhook is triggered eg: ```{"vendor_account_id":{"vendor_id":"MessageMedia","account_id":"MessageMediaM123"},"callback_url":"https://webhook.site/25f79a05-00cf-4997-a127-c55a889eb97a","delivery_report_id":"6737fda5-bb86-4fdb-8b62-d7ea49863801","source_number":"+61439123036","date_received":"2018-07-26T23:39:25.387Z","status":"enroute","delay":0,"submitted_date":"2018-07-26T23:39:25.382Z","original_text":"Hey there!","message_id":"a0589035-df10-4f3a-92a5-5beac2d100c3","error_code":"101","metadata":{}}```

      The order of concatentation would be `Request-Line` + `Date` + `Body` without any spaces in between. This order must be maintained to build a valid comparison string. 


      ## Verifying using public key

      Once you've created the comparison string, you need to use your public key to verify it against the signature (`X-MESSAGEMEDIA-SIGNATURE`) using RSA and the digest type of your key. 
      The way of doing this can vary depending on the language you are coding in. Below are some suggestions on which built-in functions or libraries you can use for each language:
      * PHP - [Openssl_verify](http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-verify.php)
      * Python - [Pycrypto](https://gist.github.com/lkdocs/6519372)
      * Node.js - [Crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_class_verify)

    description: |
      As MessageMedia's customer, you want to be able to ensure that callbacks are coming from MessageMedia and not from a 3rd party. Since 
      these are calls to your own system, you should be provided with an extra level of security 
      when calling your resources.

      The MessageMedia Signature Key API provides a number of endpoints 
      for managing key used to sign each unique request to ensure security 
      and the requests can't (easily) be spoofed. This is similar to using 
      HMAC in your outbound messaging (rather than HTTP Basic).

      The Signature Key API provides seven main endpoints:
      - ```Create signature key``` Create a new signature key for signature verification in callbacks.
      - ```Get signature key detail``` Retrieve the current detail of a signature key using the key_id returned in the ```create signature key``` endpoint.
      - ```Delete signature key``` Delete a signature key using the key_id returned in the ```create signature key``` endpoint.
      - ```Get signature key list``` Retrieve the paginated list of signature keys.
      - ```Enable signature key``` Enable a signature key using the key_id returned in the ```create signature key``` endpoint.
      - ```Get enabled signature key``` Retrieve the current enabled signature key.
      - ```Disable an enabled signature key``` Disable the current enabled signature key.

    description: |
      The mobile landing pages (MLP) API provides the facilities to create mobile landing pages and sends them to recipients. This API is currently in beta.

      ## Concepts

      The approach to creating mobile landing pages involves creating a _Campaign_ and sending them to one or more _Recipients_.  A campaign consists of the baseline configuration of a mobile landing page and message that will be generated and sent to each recipient.

      ## Parameters

      Campaign and Recipients can contain parameters.  These parameters are used to customise the generated landing page and the message that is to be sent to each user.  Campaign and Recipient parameters are merged to form a complete set when processing a recipient.

      When resolving parameters sets, Recipient parameters override Campaign parameters with the same name.

      Parameter names used within the template have an associated type, which will be validated when creating the Campaign or sending it to Recipients.  You are free to define additional parameters for your own uses, such as when specifying the message.

      The SMS message that is to be sent to each user is defined at the Campaign level. 

      The message itself can consist of parameter references surrounded in `${...}`, for example:

      ```Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}, this is your message.```

      ## Sending Mobile Landing Pages 

      From end to end, sending a Mobile Landing Pages involves the following steps: 

      ### Step 1: Create a campaign

      Choose a template from the template catalogue, and work out what you are going to specify for the required parameters for that template. You will then use the `Create new campaign` endpoint to create the campaign. The following example 
      specifies the desired parameters for the template_id and sets up a message template:

      ```
      {
          "template_id": "ac895f01-3149-4bf8-a8fe-01d3b8a9ba97",
          "parameters": {
            "pageTitle": "The page title",
            "pageText": "The body text",
            "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
            "secondaryImageUrl": "https://www.example.com/optional_secondary_image.jpg",
            "buttonLink": "https://example.com/",
            "buttonText": "Call to Action Button Text",
            "secondaryButtonLink": "https://example.com/optional_secondary_button",
            "secondaryButtonText": "Secondary Call to Action Button"
          },
          "message": {
            "content": "Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}, this is the SMS message body",
            "metadata": {
              "key": "value"
            }
          }
      }
      ```

      Inside the message content the `{}` curly braces indicate template placeholders. These are the names of the parameters you will need to specify for the message when you send to your recipients.

      ### Step 2: Send to recipients

      Using the `Send campaign to recipients` endpoint, you can specify the id of your campaign in the path and a array of recipients as the payload. Each recipient will include an E.164 formatted 
      (international) phone number, an optional scheduled time, and values of any recipient scoped template parameters you may have created. In the following example the recipients have been scoped with the template parameters above: 

      ```
      {
        "recipients": [
          {
            "number": "+6140000000",
            "parameters": { "firstName":"Joe", "lastName","Bloe" }
          },
          {
            "number": "+6141111111",
            "parameters": { "firstName":"Jane", "lastName","Doe" }
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      ## Landing Page Store

      The Landing Page Store is used by the Hub portal to store landing page templates that have been configured using the visual interface. This means that you can 
      optionally use this data store to programatically send landing pages that have been designed and configured in the hub.

      If you have made a landing page in the hub, use the `Get landing pages` endpoint to find the landing pages you have made, along with the template and parameters that have been configured. 
      You will then need to copy those template and parameters into a campaign. 

      ## Template Parameters

      Each template will have different required parameters, shown in the Templates section. The following is a description of the requirements of each parameter when included in a template.

        Retrieve the current status of a message using the message ID returned
        in the send messages end point.

        A successful request to the get message status endpoint will return a
        response body as follows:

        ```json

        {
            "format": "SMS",

            "status": "enroute"
        }

        ```

        The status property of the response indicates the current status of the
        message. See the Delivery Reports section of this documentation for more information on message
        statues.

      summary: Cancel scheduled message
      description: |
        Cancel a scheduled message that has not yet been delivered.

        A scheduled message can be cancelled by updating the status of a message
        from ```scheduled``` to ```cancelled```. This is done by submitting a PUT request to the
        messages endpoint using the message ID as a parameter (the same endpoint used above to retrieve
        the status of a message).

        The body of the request simply needs to contain a ```status``` property with the value set to ```cancelled```.

        ```json

        {
            "status": "cancelled"
        }

        ```

        *Note: Only messages with a status of scheduled can be cancelled. If an invalid or non existent message ID parameter is specified in the request, then a HTTP 404 Not Found response will be returned*

        Submit one or more (up to 100 per request) SMS, MMS or text to voice
        messages for delivery.

        The most basic message has the following structure:

        ```json

        {
            "messages": [
                {
                    "content": "My first message!",
                    "destination_number": "+61491570156"
                }
            ]
        }

        ```

        More advanced delivery features can be specified by setting the
        following properties in a message:

        - ```callback_url``` A URL can be included with each message to which
        Webhooks will be pushed to via a HTTP POST request. Webhooks will be sent if and when the status of the message changes as it is processed (if the delivery report property of the request is set to ```true```) and when replies are received. Specifying a callback URL is optional.

        - ```content``` The content of the message. This can be a Unicode string, up to 5,000 characters long.
          Message content is required.

        - ```delivery_report``` Delivery reports can be requested with each
        message. If delivery reports are requested, a webhook will be submitted to the ```callback_url``` property specified for the message (or to the webhooks)
          specified for the account every time the status of the message changes as it is processed. The
          current status of the message can also be retrieved via the Delivery Reports endpoint of the
          Messages API. Delivery reports are optional and by default will not be requested.

        - ```destination_number``` The destination number the message should be
        delivered to. This should be specified in E.164
          international format. For information on E.164, please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164.
          A destination number is required.

        - ```format``` The format specifies which format the message will be
        sent as, ```SMS``` (text message), ```MMS``` (multimedia message)
          or ```TTS``` (text to speech). With ```TTS``` format, we will call the destination number and read out the
          message using a computer generated voice. Specifying a format is optional, by default ```SMS``` will be used.

        - ```source_number``` A source number may be specified for the message,
        this will be the number that
          the message appears from on the handset. By default this feature is _not_ available and will be ignored
          in the request. Please contact <support@messagemedia.com> for more information. Specifying a source
          number is optional and a by default a source number will be assigned to the message.

        - ```media``` The media is used to specify a list of URLs of the media file(s) that you are trying to send. 
        Supported file formats include png, jpeg and gif. ```format``` parameter must be set to ```MMS``` for this to
        work.

        - ```subject``` The subject field is used to denote subject of the MMS
        message and has a maximum size of 64 characters long. Specifying a
        subject is optional.

        - ```source_number_type``` If a source number is specified, the type of
        source number may also be
          specified. This is recommended when using a source address type that is not an internationally
          formatted number, available options are ```INTERNATIONAL```, ```ALPHANUMERIC``` or ```SHORTCODE```. Specifying a
          source number type is only valid when the ```source_number``` parameter is specified and is optional.
          If a source number is specified and no source number type is specified, the source number type will be
          inferred from the source number, however this may be inaccurate.

        - ```scheduled``` A message can be scheduled for delivery in the future
        by setting the scheduled property.
          The scheduled property expects a date time specified in ISO 8601 format. The scheduled time must be
          provided in UTC and is optional. If no scheduled property is set, the message will be delivered immediately.

        - ```message_expiry_timestamp``` A message expiry timestamp can be
        provided to specify the latest time
          at which the message should be delivered. If the message cannot be delivered before the specified
          message expiry timestamp elapses, the message will be discarded. Specifying a message expiry 
          timestamp is optional.

        - ```metadata``` Metadata can be included with the message which will
        then be included with any delivery
          reports or replies matched to the message. This can be used to create powerful two-way messaging
          applications without having to store persistent data in the application. Up to 10 key / value metadata data
          pairs can be specified in a message. Each key can be up to 100 characters long, and each value up to 
          256 characters long. Specifying metadata for a message is optional.

        The response body of a successful POST request to the messages endpoint
        will include a ```messages``` property which contains a list of all messages submitted. The list of
        messages submitted will reflect the list of messages included in the request, but each message
        will also contain two new properties, ```message_id``` and ```status```. The returned message ID
        will be a 36 character UUID which can be used to check the status of the message via the Get Message
        Status endpoint. The status of the message which reflect the status of the message at submission
        time which will always be ```queued```. See the Delivery Reports section of this documentation for
        more information on message statues.

        *Note: when sending multiple messages in a request, all messages must be valid for the request 
        to be successful. If any messages in the request are invalid, no messages will be sent.*

        Check for any delivery reports that have been received.
        Delivery reports are a notification of the change in status of a message as it is being processed.
        Each request to the check delivery reports endpoint will return any delivery reports received that
        have not yet been confirmed using the confirm delivery reports endpoint. A response from the check
        delivery reports endpoint will have the following structure:

        ```
        Each delivery report will contain details about the message, including any metadata specified
        and the new status of the message (as each delivery report indicates a change in status of a
        message) and the timestamp at which the status changed. Every delivery report will have a 
        unique delivery report ID for use with the confirm delivery reports endpoint.
        *Note: The source number and destination number properties in a delivery report are the inverse of
        those specified in the message that the delivery report relates to. The source number of the
        delivery report is the destination number of the original message.*
        Subsequent requests to the check delivery reports endpoint will return the same delivery reports
        and a maximum of 100 delivery reports will be returned in each request. Applications should use the
        confirm delivery reports endpoint in the following pattern so that delivery reports that have been
        processed are no longer returned in subsequent check delivery reports requests.
        1. Call check delivery reports endpoint
        2. Process each delivery report
        3. Confirm all processed delivery reports using the confirm delivery reports endpoint
        *Note: It is recommended to use the Webhooks feature to receive reply messages rather than
        polling the check delivery reports endpoint.*

        Mark a delivery report as confirmed so it is no longer return in check delivery reports requests.
        The confirm delivery reports endpoint is intended to be used in conjunction with the check delivery
        reports endpoint to allow for robust processing of delivery reports. Once one or more delivery
        reports have been processed, they can then be confirmed using the confirm delivery reports endpoint so they
        are no longer returned in subsequent check delivery reports requests.
        The confirm delivery reports endpoint takes a list of delivery report IDs as follows:
        ```json
        {
            "delivery_report_ids": [
                "011dcead-6988-4ad6-a1c7-6b6c68ea628d",

            ]
        }
        ```
        Up to 100 delivery reports can be confirmed in a single confirm delivery reports request.

      description: |-
        Check for any replies that have been received.
        Replies are messages that have been sent from a handset in response to a message sent by an
        application or messages that have been sent from a handset to a inbound number associated with
        an account, known as a dedicated inbound number (contact <support@messagemedia.com> for more
        information on dedicated inbound numbers).
        Each request to the check replies endpoint will return any replies received that have not yet
        been confirmed using the confirm replies endpoint. A response from the check replies endpoint
        will have the following structure:

                        "vendor_id": "MessageMedia",

                    },
                    "content": "My first reply!"
                },
                {

                    },
                    "content": "My second reply!"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
        Each reply will contain details about the reply message, as well as details of the message the reply was sent
        in response to, including any metadata specified. Every reply will have a reply ID to be used with the
        confirm replies endpoint.
        *Note: The source number and destination number properties in a reply are the inverse of those
        specified in the message the reply is in response to. The source number of the reply message is the
        same as the destination number of the original message, and the destination number of the reply
        message is the same as the source number of the original message. If a source number
        wasn't specified in the original message, then the destination number property will not be present
        in the reply message.*
        Subsequent requests to the check replies endpoint will return the same reply messages and a maximum
        of 100 replies will be returned in each request. Applications should use the confirm replies endpoint
        in the following pattern so that replies that have been processed are no longer returned in
        subsequent check replies requests.
        1. Call check replies endpoint
        2. Process each reply message
        3. Confirm all processed reply messages using the confirm replies endpoint
        *Note: It is recommended to use the Webhooks feature to receive reply messages rather than polling
        the check replies endpoint.*

      summary: Lookup a phone number
      description: |
        Use the Lookups API to find information about a phone number.

        A request to the lookups API has the following format:

        ```/v1/lookups/phone/{phone_number}?options={x}```

        where `{x}` is an individual value or a combination of values. 

        The `{phone_number}` parameter is a required field and should be set to the phone number to be looked up.

        The options query parameter can also be used to request additional information about the phone number.

        By default, a request will only return the `country_code` and `phone_number` properties in the response.

        ```json
        {  "country_code": "AU", "phone_number": "+61491570156"}
        ```

        To request details about the the carrier, include `carrier` as a value of the options parameter and to 
        request details about the type, include `type` as a value of the options parameter. The `carrier` and
        the `type` values can be used together using a comma separated list, i.e. `carrier,type`.

        To request details about the location, include `hlr` as a value of the options parameter. 

        NOTE: The `hlr` value CANNOT be used in conjuction with the other values.

        A successful request to the lookups endpoint with `carrier` and `type` as values will 

        return a response body as follows:

        ```json
        {  
          "country_code": "AU",
          "phone_number": "+61491570156",
          "type": "mobile",  "carrier": {"name": "Telstra"  }
        }
        ```

        A successful request to the lookups endpoint with `hlr` as the value will return a response body as follows:

        ```json
        {"result": "OK",    "imsi": 24008,    "location": 46}
        ```
        Each property in the response body is defined as follows:- ```country_code``` ISO ALPHA 2 country code of the phone number
        - ```phone_number``` E.164 formatted phone number
        - ```type``` The type of number. This can be ```"mobile"``` or ```"landline"```
        - ```carrier``` Holds information about the specific carrier (if available)  
        - ```name``` The carrier's name as reported by the network
        - `imsi` A unique number identifying a GSM subscriber
        - `location` The location of the mobile number"

      summary: Create webhook
      description: |
        Create a webhook for one or more of the specified events.

        A webhook would typically have the following structure:

        ```
        { 
          "url": "http://webhook.com",
          "method": "POST",
          "encoding": "JSON",  
          "headers": {"Account": "DeveloperPortal7000"  },  
          "events": ["RECEIVED_SMS"  ],
          "template": {
            "id":"$mtId",
            "status":"$statusCode"}
          }

        ```

        A valid webhook must consist of the following properties:

        - ```url``` The configured URL which will trigger the webhook when a selected event occurs.

        - ```method``` The methods to map CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) operations to HTTP requests.

        - ```encoding``` Webhooks can be delivered using different content types. You can choose from ```JSON```, ```FORM_ENCODED``` or ```XML```. This will automatically add the Content-Type header for you so you don't have to add it again in the `headers` property.

        - ```headers``` HTTP header fields which provide required information about the request or response, or about the object sent in the message body. This should NOT include the `Content-Type` header.

        - ```events``` Event or events that will trigger the webhook. Atleast one event should be present.

        - ```template``` The structure of the payload that will be returned. You can format this in JSON or XML.

        #### Types of Events

        You can select all of the events (listed below) or combine them in whatever way you like but atleast one event must be used. Otherwise, the webhook won't be created.

        A webhook will be triggered when any one or more of the events occur:

        + **SMS** 
          + `RECEIVED_SMS` Receive an SMS
          + `OPT_OUT_SMS` Opt-out occured
        + **MMS**
          + `RECEIVED_MMS` Receive an MMS
        + **DR (Delivery Reports)**
          + `ENROUTE_DR` Message is enroute
          + `EXPIRED_DR` Message has expired
          + `REJECTED_DR` Message is rejected
          + `FAILED_DR` Message has failed
          + `DELIVERED_DR` Message is delivered
          + `SUBMITTED_DR` Message is submitted

        #### Template Parameters

        You can choose what to include in the data that will be sent as the payload via the Webhook. It's upto you to choose what format you would like the payload to be returned. You can choose between JSON or XML.

        Keep in my mind, if you've chosen JSON as the format, you must escape the JSON in the template value (see example above).

        The table illustrates a list of all the parameters that can be included in the template and which event types it can be applied to.

        | Data  | Parameter Name | Example | Event Type |

      summary: Create signature key
      description: |-
        This will create a key pair:

        - The ```private key``` stored in MessageMedia is used to create the signature.

        - The ```public key``` is returned and stored at your side to verify the signature in callbacks.

        You need to enable your signature key after creating.

        The most basic body has the following structure:

        ```json
        {
            "digest": "SHA224",
            "cipher": "RSA"
        }
        ```

        - ```digest``` is used to hash the message. The valid values for digest type are: SHA224, SHA256, SHA512

        - ```cipher``` is used to encrypt the hashed message. The valid value for cipher type is: RSA

        A successful request for the ```create signature key``` endpoint will return a response body as follows:

        ```json
        {
            "key_id": "7ca628a8-08b0-4e42-aeb8-960b37049c31",
            "public_key": "MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCTIxtRyT5CuOD74r7UCT+AKzWNxvaAP9myjAqR7+vBnJKEvoPnmbKTnm6uLlxutnMbjKrnCCWnQ9vtBVnnd+ElhwLDPADfMcJoOqwi7mTcxucckeEbBsfsgYRfdacxgSZL8hVD1hLViQr3xwjEIkJcx1w3x8npvwMuTY0uW8+PjwIDAQAB",
            "cipher": "RSA",
            "digest": "SHA224",
            "created": "2018-01-18T10:16:12.364Z",
            "enabled": false
        }
        ```

        The response body of a successful POST request to the ```create signature key``` endpoint will contain six properties:

        - ```key_id``` will be a 36 character UUID which can be used to enable, delete or get the details.

        - ```public_key``` is used to decrypt the signature.

        - ```cipher``` same as cipher in request body.

        - ```digest``` same as digest in request body.

        - ```created``` is the created date.

        - ```enabled``` is false for the new signature key. You can use the ```enable signature key``` endpoint to set this field to true.

      description: |-
        Enable a signature key using the key_id returned in the ```create signature key``` endpoint.
        There is only one signature key is enabled at the one moment in time. So if you enable the new signature key, the old one will be disabled.

        The most basic body has the following structure:

        ```json
        {
            "key_id": "7ca628a8-08b0-4e42-aeb8-960b37049c31"
        }
        ```

        The response body of a successful PATCH request to ```enable signature key``` endpoint will contain the ```enabled``` properties with the value is true as follows:

        ```json
        {
            "key_id": "7ca628a8-08b0-4e42-aeb8-960b37049c31",

        ### Events Types

        The campaign report consists of a series of events, that were generated by recipients when
        interacting with the generated mobile landing page.  The set of events that are currently supported
        are as follows:

        | Event Type        | Event Source | Description                                    |
        |:------------------|:-------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
        | `PAGE_OPEN`       | n/a          | The page was opened in a browser.              |
        | `BUTTON_CLICKED`  | Button label | One of the Call to Action buttons was clicked. |
        | `FORM_SUBMITTED`  | n/a          | A form has been submitted with the captured data stored in the 'data' field. |Returns the breakdown of events and recipients of a particular campaign.

        This will contain the following bits of information:

        - The total number of events recorded for the particular campaign.

        - The number of unique engagements.  This is the number of recipients for which there exists at least one recorded event.

        - A breakdown of the number of the total number of events grouped by the event type and event source

        The event breakdown will return the following information for each event and source type:

        - The total number of recorded events of that type and source

        - The number of unique recipients for which that event and source was recorded for at least once

        For example, if a recipient opened the landing page three times, the number of recorded events will be 3 but the number of unique recipients will be 1.
